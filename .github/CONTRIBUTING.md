## Before Submitting an Issue

First, please do a search in open issues to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed. If there is an issue add your comments to this issue.


Before post a new issue, upgrade:

- Delete `$GOPATH/src/github.com/kataras`
- Open shell and execute the command: `go get -u github.com/kataras/cli`
- Try to re-produce the issue
- If the issue still exists, then post the issue with the necessary information.



## Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request, do not file combo issues.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful reproducing the issue and finding a fix. Therefore:

* Provide reproducable steps, what the result of the steps was, and what you would have expected.
* Description of what you expect to happen
* Animated GIFs
* Code that demonstrates the issue
* Version of cli
* Errors in the Terminal/Console
* When you have glide/godep installed, can you reproduce the issue when starting your cli app  without these?
